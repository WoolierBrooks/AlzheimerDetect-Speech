[+ exc]  we have here a scene in a kitchen and it looks as though that's a 	mama who is working at the sink and her two children .  and the two children are hoping that mama will not notice because 	she's looking out the window that they are getting into the cookie 	jar .  so the boy climbs up on a stool to reach the cookie jar .  and as he's getting up there the [/] &s <the tool [: stool] 	[* pw-ret]> [//] the stool is tilting and he looks as though he were 	about to fall over .  and the little girl is telling him to be quiet by putting her 	finger on her lips .  he has one cookie in his hand, is reaching for another one .  the lid is off the cookie jar .  the cupboard door is open .  he's supposedly going to hand one cookie, it looks as though he is, 	to his sister and grab another one for himself but I doubt he's [//] 	that he's gonna get all that done before the stool falls over .  <on the other> [//] around the corner of the kitchen &uh &um 	there's a counter that &uh sort_of turns a corner .  there are cupboards below the counter and above the counter where 	the cookies are .  then when you get over and have turned a corner in the kitchen you 	have base cabinets and then you have a window above that which is 	looking out into something which makes it looks as though it's 	summer outside (be)cause the window is open .  there are things growing out there .  there's a walk .  there's &uh &uh some shrubbery underneath another window that looks 	it's in a another wing of the house .  there's a tree beyond .  there are tie back curtains at the window .  the mother is working at the sink and the faucet is left on and 	apparently there's no overflow in the sink so it's overflowing right 	onto the floor splash@o [/] splash@o .  and &uh she has on a sleeveless dress which also indicates that 	it's summer .  and it looks though she has an apron on .  she has short hair .  &um she is drying <a dish with a tea towel> [//] a plate with a tea 	towel .  &um beside the sink there are two cups and a plate .  looks as though there's some suds and some dishes in the sink . 	[+ gram]  and two faucets with x@l type handles one on either side and a 	center faucet . [+ gram]  she has shoes on with no ties, just sort of slip+on shoes .  there's a little scallop valance across the top of the curtains .  &hm (.) I think that's all I'm gonna tell you . [+ exc]  well â€¡ the handles on the door are the kind that are just &um 	almost like a round piece of wood that you hafta get a hold of to 	pull the cupboard door open .  and what's really strange is that you can't see any handles on the 	cupboards on the other side of the kitchen .
the pearl [: poor] [* p:w] &mo mom's gettin(g) her wet [//] feet 	wet (be)cause she thinking of days gone by and then the water run .
