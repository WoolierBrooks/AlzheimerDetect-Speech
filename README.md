# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction via Voice Analysis

This repository delves into using Python-based tools for Alzheimer's disease prediction using voice data. Initially, the Pitt Corpus dataset, including recordings from individuals with regular cognitive function and Dementia patients, was utilized. The raw audio underwent segmentation and transformation using the TRESTLE tool and Librosa audio processing library.

We attempted to use only the patient's voice without feature extraction due to the lack of literature on this approach. However, our initial models were ineffective in distinguishing dementia from control individuals. Consequently, we're exploring alternative data representation domains to enhance prediction accuracy, and our latest models have achieved >79% accuracy. The project aims to conclude by around September of 2024.
